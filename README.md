# IBM_CAPSTONE_PROJECT
1.Found top complaint type by performing these steps. 
Downloaded data file from 311 NYP database. 
Pre-processed data using pandas.
Performed analysis and visualisation using Numpy and Matplotlib. 
Used IBM wenston and cloud platform, created project, cloud-object and added notebook to project. Imported cloud-object credentials using python script for data file files upload/download.

Imported cloud-object credentials using python script for data file files upload/download. 

b.From the analysis on NYHPD data set it is found that the Evaluation of top complaint
type had different trends among borughs, ZIP codes and street_name .
It is more concentrated in some regions than other regions(Ex:Bronx area had more Top_complaint ratio than Queens and Staten),
also for streets_name and incident_zip codes the Top_Complaint type is proritized 
(Ex:Elmhurst avenue street from Queens had Top_complaint ration than Brooklyn).

Pre-processed data using pandas used various approaches normalisation,merging,grouping and all...
Performed statistical analysis and visualisation using Scipy, Matplotlib,pandas,numpy libs.
Used IBM wenston and cloud platform, created project, cloud-object and added notebook to project.
Imported cloud-object credentials using python script for data file files upload/download.

b.From the analysis on NYHPD and PLUTO data sets, it was found from the Visualisation and 
Evaluation that the complaint types are highly correlated with the most of the Building features.
